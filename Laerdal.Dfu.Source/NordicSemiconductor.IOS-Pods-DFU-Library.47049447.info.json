  "body": "This version introduces the following features:\r\n- Sending Abort command in case of an error to a DFU bootloader from SDK 15 or newer to quickly reset the target into application mode (#447). Devices from SDK 12-14 will continue to just be disconnected.\r\n- Using connection timeout during reconnections, instead of hardcoded 5 second timeout (#442).\r\n- Bug fix: Handling situations when object size is reported to be 0 bytes (#443 and #444). \r\n- Bug fix: Missing error codes added. That was causing crashes (#446). \r\n- Minor code improvements (#448, #445).\r\n- Read Object Info was renamed to Select Object, to be more inline with Secure DFU specification (cb29e88a06944ba559e2015cef61d4a4e677330c)."
